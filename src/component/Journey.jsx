          I'm Jatin Srivastava, a passionate MERN stack developer currently
          pursuing my Master of Computer Applications at BBD University,
          Lucknow. My journey into software development began in 2022, igniting
          my interest in creating dynamic web applications. I excel in
          full-stack development, specializing in Node.js, Express.js, React.js,
          and MongoDB. My coursework and projects have equipped me with robust
          skills in database management, backend API development, and UI design
          for scalable applications. Beyond technical skills, I thrive in
          collaborative environments, contributing innovative solutions with
          effective communication and adaptability. Outside of coding, I enjoy
          sports and outdoor activities, maintaining a balanced lifestyle that
          fuels my curiosity and commitment to continuous improvement.
